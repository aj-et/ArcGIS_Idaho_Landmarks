# Overview

For this project, I decided to learn ArcGIS mapping. I created my own data for the landmarks and I also took data of the church temples that filters only the temples that are located in Idaho.

The purpose of creating this app is to know what landmarks (historical or not) that are in Idaho. This is for people who want to explore what Idhao has to offer.

I only used the ArcGIS online app and CSV/Excel for the tools for this project.
